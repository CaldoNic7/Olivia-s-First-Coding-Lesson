# Olivia's E-CARD (html/css/scss)
I am teaching my daughter html and css. She wanted to make her mom a christmas card as her first project. Everything except for the falling snowflakes is 100% her code. I gave her styling guidance and helped her google css properties but she wrote all of the code. 

### Snowflakes:
We got the snowflakes from [here](https://www.cssscript.com/css-only-snow-falling-effect/)
